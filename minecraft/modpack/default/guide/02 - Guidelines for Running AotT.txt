§0§l§nForeword from the Pack Author§r

Ascension of the Technomancer is a very demanding pack, on both the player and the system.  Because of this, I personally recommend that you allocate 8GB to an SSP instance of this pack, with a minimum of 6GB.  If you are playing SMP then you can probably work with 4GB for the client and 3-4GB for the server (depending on the player base size).  I am aware that this runs contrary to the typical advice of 4GB for large 1.7.10 packs.  The reason for this is due to the use of multiple very large mods (GregTech, Advent of Ascension, Chromaticraft) in addition to the standard 1.7.10 kitchen sink fare.  I also recommend that you launch the pack through MultiMC (It can directly load in FTB packs installed on your client).  For the convenience of those with a less technical background, I have provided the JVM arguments I personally use at the bottom of this page.  Just copy them into your instance settings on the system page.  These settings are for a machine with 12-16GB of RAM.  A strong single thread CPU core speed is also necessary for this pack (Minecraft can only use a single thread for the main game engine). 3.5Ghz+ is recommended.  Different hardware can have considerably variable performance, the only way to know for sure is to test things out on your system and see what works.  A good graphics card helps as well, as does using the "Fast Graphics" setting to turn off leaf transparency.  

I would also recommend not living next to a village, or especially a Roguelike Dungeon (you will often find both of then in close proximity to each other), as these structures have lot's of entities and can affect performance.  You may also want to avoid "swiss cheesing" the area under your base while mining to reduce the number of spawnable locations near your base full of ticking tile entities.  Finally, I recommend spreading out your builds to avoid having too many rapidly updating chunks being redrawn all around you.  Be sparing with chunkloading, but loaded chunks have no where near the same performance hit if they are not being actively redrawn.

This pack uses Journeymap as the in-game mapping utility as it is by far the most feature rich option available, however it can be quite resource intensive on your system.  Setting a max range of .5km to 1km for in-game waypoint rendering can have a significant beneficial impact on your your framerate.  Creating waypoints is an excellent way to keep track of the location of GregTech ore veins, dungeons, ruins, and cities you find in your travels.  You do not needed to waypoint Thaumcraft aura nodes though, as the TC Node Tracker mod has included for this purpose.  Turning off mob tracking can also highly recommended for performance, along with making your AotT experience more immersive (and challenging) by not giving the player clairvoyance as to where all living creatures in the area are right now.

Fastcraft was included by default to ease the system burden.  If Fastcraft doesn't work for you, feel free to swap it out for CoFH Tweaks.  You cannot use both of them at the same time, and in most cases Fastcraft performs better.  Some systems don't seem to play nice with Fastcraft, so I figured I would mention a possible alternative here.  

Optifine is also highly recommended and I have experienced no compatibility issues with it.  I use OptiFine_1.7.10_HD_U_D6 so I can only vouch for the compatibility of that version (D6) with the mod loadout.  Be aware that Optifine's Performance->Fast Renderer (different from Minecraft's Fast Graphics setting) will cause Z-fighting with some mods, "Fast Math" may also be affected.

Certain mods are also heavier on the frame rate than others.  Large banks of Storage Drawers can cause an FPS hit due to displaying the lables on the drawers, the labels can be suppressed using features of that mod.  Large Agricraft farms are also very heavy FPS hitters, especially with sprinklers.  You are better off keeping your farms away from banks of machinery and just chunkload them via FTB Utils.  Forge micro-blocks are another thing to be used sparingly and with care (Chisels and Bit's they are not).

Finally, if you are experiencing lag problems when generating new chunks, you can make use of the Chunk Pre-Generator mod to create new chunks for the overworld or any other dimension.  Simply press the I key to bring up the in-game UI for controlling this amazingly robust chunk generation solution.  The controls for it are to complex to really outline here.  I recommend going to the official download site for this mod and reviewing the documentation there to get a feel for what this tool can do for you.
